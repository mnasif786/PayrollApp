SELECT e.Name,
CAST(((s.AnnualAmount * 1)/c.ConvertionFactor) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) As AmountInGBP
FROM Employees e 
	JOIN Salaries  s ON e.EmpolyeeId = s.EmployeeId
	JOIN Currencies c ON s.CurrencyId = c.CurrencyId



I have used this Coversion Formula:

amount(from) * rate(from) / rate(to)

for example: 

2*1/1.54 = 1.29 GBP

means

2 dollar = 1.29 GBP
